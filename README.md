# FirstTryProjectJava
Hi,This is my first coding project on GitHub, where I explore the basics of programming . The project includes simple scripts written in java . Through this, I aim to learn how to collaborate using Git, manage repositories, and improve my coding skills. Feel free to check it out, suggest improvements, or contribute!
